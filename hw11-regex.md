# ```Regex``` homework: NY State Delays in Fair Hearing Decisions?

You are a health reporter. You are starting to hear many complaints about how long it is taking New York State to issue a decision on whether someone receives long-term care aid. You get a hold of thousands of redacted Fair Hearing decision documents [sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1081J4XFvA2Slgy_raj-jR6Oqd59L09cr/view?usp=sharing). You want to capture:
- The request date (found at the top)
- The fair hearing decision date (found near bottom of each case)
- The fair hearing case number (found near the top as a ```FH#```)

You don't have to do this for this homework, but here is our scenario: Once you have all this into a dataframe, your goal is to calculate how long it takes between the request and the decision. Has the amount time increased or decreased, or remained unchanged over the years?

## Back to the homework:

Paste two sample cases below into a ```regex101.com``` window. Your ```regex``` should capture a set of the values above for each case. For the sake of visual clarity, the two cases are separated by:

APPLICABLE LAW
__
In general, a recipient of Public Assistance, Medical Assistance or Services (including
child care and supportive services) has a right to a timely and adequate notice when the Agency
proposes to discontinue, suspend, reduce or change the manner of payment of such benefits. An
adequate, though not timely, notice is required where the Agency has accepted or denied an
application for Public Assistance, Medical Assistance or Services; or has increased the Public
Assistance grant; or has determined to change the amount of one of the items used in the
calculation of a Public Assistance grant or Medical Assistance spend down; or has determined
that an individual is not eligible for an exemption from work requirements. 18 NYCRR 358-
3.3(a). In addition, pursuant to 18 NYCRR 358-3.3(d), an adequate, though not timely, notice is
required for a Public Assistance or Medical Assistance recipient when, for example, the Agency
has factual information confirming the death of the recipient; the Agency has received a clear
written statement from the recipient that he or she no longer wishes to receive Public Assistance
or Medical Assistance; the Agency has reliable information that the recipient has been admitted
3
FH# 7244567H
to an institution or prison; the recipient’s whereabouts are unknown and mail has been returned
to the Agency; or the recipient has been accepted for Public Assistance or Medical Assistance in
another district.
A timely notice means a notice which is mailed at least 10 days before the date upon
which the proposed action is to become effective. 18 NYCRR 358-2.23.
An adequate notice is a notice of action, an adverse action notice or an action taken
notice which sets forth the action that the Agency proposes to take or is taking, and if a single
notice is used for all affected assistance, benefits or services, the effect of such action, if any, on
a recipient's other assistance, benefits or services. In addition, the notice must contain:
o for reductions, the previous and new amounts of assistance or benefits provided;
o the effective date of the action;
o the specific reasons for the action;
o the specific laws and/or regulations upon which the action is based;
o the recipient's right to request an agency conference and fair hearing;
o the procedure for requesting an agency conference or fair hearing, including an address and
telephone number where a request for a fair hearing may be made and the time limits within
which the request for a fair hearing must be made;
o an explanation that a request for a conference is not a request for a fair hearing and that a
separate request for a fair hearing must be made;
o a statement that a request for a conference does not entitle one to aid continuing and that a
right to aid continuing only arises pursuant to a request for a fair hearing;
o the circumstances under which public assistance, medical assistance, SNAP benefits or
services will be continued or reinstated until the fair hearing decision is issued;
o a statement that a fair hearing must be requested separately from a conference;
o a statement that when only an agency conference is requested and there is no specific
request for a fair hearing, there is no right to continued public assistance, medical
assistance, SNAP benefits or services;
o a statement that participation in an agency conference does not affect the right to request a
fair hearing;
4
FH# 7244567H
o the right of the recipient to review the case record and to obtain copies of documents which
the agency will present into evidence at the hearing and other documents necessary for the
recipient to prepare for the fair hearing at no cost;
o an address and telephone number where the recipient can obtain additional information
about the recipient's case, how to request a fair hearing, access to the case file, and/or
obtaining copies of documents;
o the right to representation by legal counsel, a relative, friend or other person or to represent
oneself, and the right to bring witnesses to the fair hearing and to question witnesses at the
hearing;
o the right to present written and oral evidence at the hearing;
o the liability, if any, to repay continued or reinstated assistance and benefits, if the recipient
loses the fair hearing;
o information concerning the availability of community legal services to assist a recipient at
the conference and fair hearing; and
o a copy of the budget or the basis for the computation, in instances where the social services
agency's determination is based upon a budget computation.
18 NYCRR 358-2.2
DISCUSSION
The Agency's determination to discontinue the Appellant's Medical Assistance benefits
cannot be sustained.
The uncontroverted evidence presented at the hearing established that the Appellant,
legally adjudicated incompetent, has been in receipt of Medical Assistance coverage through a
Managed Long Term Care Plan, (Centers Plan), referred to as “Agency” for the purposes of this
decision. The Appellant’s Medical Assistance coverage has included skilled nursing facility
services, and the Appellant has been residing and continues to reside at a skilled nursing facility
(Terrace View) since January 23, 2015 on a permanent basis. By notice dated February 2, 2016,
the Agency notified the incompetent Appellant of its intent to “not approve” her Medical
Assistance coverage retroactive to January 1, 2016. No notice was provided to the Appellant’s
legally appointed guardian, and no aid continuing was authorized.
As a recipient of Medical Assistance, the Appellant is entitled to timely and adequate
notice. See, 18 NYCRR 358-3.3. The notice under review was neither timely nor adequate.
As set forth in 18 NYCRR 358-2.23, a timely notice must be mailed to the recipient at least
10 days before the date upon which the proposed action is to become effective. The Agency
5
FH# 7244567H
notice under review was retroactively effective to January 1, 2016, which did not afford the
Appellant timely notice as required by regulation. Furthermore, 18 NYCRR 358-2.2, requires
the Agency to set forth the correct action the Agency proposes to take in order to meet the
definition of an adequate notice. In this case, the Agency framed its action as a denial with its
indication that the Medical Assistance coverage the Appellant had been receiving was suddenly
“not approved” retroactive to January 1, 2016. The Agency offered no evidence to show that the
Medical Assistance the Appellant has been receiving was ever discontinued previously with a
timely and adequate notice. The Agency’s mischaracterization of its action as a denial was not
adequate under the regulations. Finally, it was undisputed that the Agency was aware that the
Appellant had been legally adjudicated incompetent, and that Legal Services for the Elderly were
her Court-appointed Guardian. Notwithstanding, the Agency only advised the Appellant of its
determination, which was prejudicial as this particular Appellant was completely unable to
evaluate the information contained in it, and further deprived her of the opportunity for aid
continuing while this matter is pending. The combination of defects in the February 2nd notice
is found to deprive the Appellant of due process, and renders such notice void as a matter of law.
Accordingly, the determination under review must be reversed.
DECISION AND ORDER
The Agency's determination to discontinue the Appellant's Medical Assistance benefits
cannot be sustained.
1. The Agency is directed to reinstate and restore the Appellant's Medical Assistance
benefits retroactive to January 1, 2016 the effective date of the Agency's action.
2. In the event that the Agency determines to implement its previously contemplated
action, the Agency is directed to provide the Appellant and the Appellant’s Guardian with a
notice that meets the requirements set forth in 18 NYCRR 358-2.2 and 358-2.23.
As required by 18 NYCRR 358-6.4, the Agency must comply immediately with the
directives set forth above.

I. Scope of the Personal Care Benefit
a. As required by federal regulations, the personal care services benefit afforded to
MCO enrollees must be furnished in an amount, duration, and scope that is no less
6
FH# 7212695N
than the services furnished to Medicaid fee-for-service recipients.[42 CFR
§438.210]…
i. The assessment process should evaluate and document when and
to what degree the member requires assistance with personal care services
tasks and whether needed assistance with tasks can be scheduled or may
occur at unpredictable times during the day or night. The assessment
process should also evaluate the availability of informal supports who may
be willing and available to provide assistance with needed tasks and
whether the member’s day or nighttime needs can totally or partially be
met through the use of efficiencies and specialized medical equipment
including, but not limited to, commode, urinal, walker, wheelchair, etc. A
care plan must be developed that meets the member’s scheduled and
unscheduled day and nighttime personal needs.
Section 505.14(a)(1) of the Regulations defines "Personal Care Services" to mean some
or total assistance with personal hygiene, dressing and feeding; and nutritional and
environmental support functions. Such services must be essential to the maintenance of the
patient's health and safety in his or her own home…
Section 505.14(a) of the Regulations further provides, in part, that:
(2) Some or total assistance shall be defined as follows:
(i) Some assistance shall mean that a specific function or task is performed and
completed by the patient with help from another individual.
(ii) Total assistance shall mean that a specific function or task is performed and
completed for the patient.

Uniform Assessment System for New York, dated September 24, 2013 reminds Plans of MLTC
Policy 13.09: Transition of Semi-Annual Assessment of Members to the Uniform Assessment
System for New York which in turn indicates that effective October 1, 2013, the Uniform
Assessment System for New York (UAS-NY) will replace the Semi-Annual Assessment of
Members (SAAM). As per the statewide implementation plan, Plans must use the UAS-NY for
all new members who are scheduled to enroll effective October 1, 2013; the SAAM assessment
must not be used for these new enrollees. Additionally, the UAS-NY must be used for all
reassessments beginning October 1, 2013.
Section 438.402 of 42 CFR Subpart F provides in part:
7
FH# 7212695N
(a) The grievance system. Each MCO [Managed Care Organization] and PIHP
[Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan] must have a system in place, for enrollees, that
includes a grievance process, an appeal process, and access to the State's fair
hearing system...
Section 4403-f of the Public Health Law pertains to Managed Long Term Care Plans.
Article 49 of the Public Health Law pertains to Utilization Review and External Appeal.
The Managed Long Term Care Model Contract provides that “New York has elected to
require that a member exhaust the plan’s internal appeal process before an enrollee may request a
State Fair Hearing.”
For all MLTC partial capitation plan decisions made on or after July 1, 2015, that deny,
reduce or discontinue enrollees’ services, enrollees may request a State fair hearing from the
NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (“OTDA”) immediately.
This change in policy has the following effects:
1) enrollees are no longer required to exhaust their plan’s internal appeals processes before
obtaining a State fair hearing;
2) aid-continuing is no longer available if the enrollee asks only for an internal appeal of a plan’s
proposed reduction or discontinuance of services and does not also timely request a State fair
hearing;
3) to obtain aid-continuing, enrollees must request a State fair hearing within 10 days of the date
of the Managed Long Term Care Action Taken notice;
4) enrollees do not need to specifically request aid-continuing to obtain it, but they may tell
OTDA that they specifically decline it; and
5) the 60 day deadline to request a State fair hearing begins on the date of the Managed Long
Term Care Action Taken notice.

In Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F. 3rd 611 (Federal Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit
1999), cert. denied 531 U.S. 864, the Plaintiffs were Personal Care Services recipients who
alleged that they would be in receipt of inadequate service not meeting legal requirements,
without the provision of safety monitoring as an independent task in their Personal Care Services
authorizations. The district court had ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs, but the Court of Appeals
held that the Agency is not required to provide safety monitoring as an independent Personal
Care Services task in evaluating the needs of applicants for and recipients of Personal Care
Services. Local Agencies were advised of this decision in GIS message 99/MA/036.
GIS 03 MA/03 was released to clarify and elaborate on the assessment of Personal Care
Services pursuant to the Court’s ruling in Rodriguez v. Novello and in accordance with existing
Department regulations and policies. In relevant portion, this GIS Message states:
12
FH# 7212695N
Social services districts should authorize assistance with recognized, medically necessary
personal care services tasks. As previously advised, social services districts are NOT
required to allot time for safety monitoring as a separate task as part of the total personal
care services hours authorized (see GIS 99 MA/013, GIS 99 MA/036). However, districts
are reminded that a clear and legitimate distinction exists between “safety monitoring” as a
non-required independent stand-alone function while no Level II personal care services task
is being provided, and the appropriate monitoring of the patient while providing assistance
with the performance of a Level II personal care services task, such as transferring,
toileting, or walking, to assure the task is being safely completed.
DISCUSSION
The credible evidence establishes that the Appellant, age 92, has been enrolled in a
Medicaid Managed Long Term Care plan through Centers Plan for Healthy Living and has been
in receipt of a Personal Care Services authorization in the amount of 84 hours per week. The
credible evidence further establishes that by Initial Adverse Determination dated December 28,
2015, the plan determined to reduce the Appellant’s Personal Care Services authorization from
84 hours per week to 70 hours per week.
The regulations pertaining to personal care services require that all notices must reflect the
reasons for reduction, of a personal care services. Appropriate reasons for reducing personal
care services include but are not limited to: the client’s medical, mental, economic or social
circumstances have changed and the Managed Care Plan determines that the personal care
services provided under the last authorization or reauthorization are no longer appropriate or can
be provided in fewer hours than they were previously. All notices must reflect the reasons for
reduction, discontinuation or denial of a reauthorization for personal care services. Appropriate
reasons for reducing, discontinuing or denying a reauthorization of personal care services include
but are not limited to: a mistake occurred in the previous personal care services authorization.
In this present case, the December 28, 2015, Notice of Initial Adverse Determination
stated in relevant part, “The plan is taking this action because the health care services is not
medically necessary.”
On January 8, 2016, the Plan upheld the Initial Adverse determination for the following
clinical reason(s):
“...has significant past medical history of high blood pressure, gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia, arthropathy, and chronic pain. You underwent a follow-up
face-to-face clinical assessment on December 16, 2015...that demonstrated that: you were
independent (requiring setup help only) for eating; your required limited assistance for bathing,
dressing (upper body) and toilet use; you required extensive assistance for bathing, dressing
(lower body) and walking/locomotion; you required maximal assistance for medication
management; and you were totally dependent for meal preparation and ordinary housework. It
was noted that your daughter's family lives next door (on the first floor) and is willing to assist
13
FH# 7212695N
you...”
The January 8, 2016 Notice further states, “Based upon your most recent assessment on
December 16, 2015 that demonstrated a significant improvement in your physical functioning, it
had been proposed that your physical needs could be met by decreasing your PCA hours to 70
hours/week (10 hours/day x 7 days/week).
In support of this determination the plan included the December 4, 2015 and June 3, 2015
Uniform Assessment System New York (UANSY) Assessment (Comprehensive) Reports of the
Appellant’s personal care needs. These Assessments were reviewed to assess whether Center's
Plan for Healthy Living's determination to reduce the Appellant's personal care services from 84
hours per week to 70 hours per week on the grounds that “not medically necessary” was correct.
A review of the June 3, 2015 Uniform Assessment System New York (UANSY)
Assessment found that the Appellant required “Total dependence, Full performance by others
during entire period” in the Functional Status section of Meal Preparation, Ordinary housework,
Stairs and Shopping. The Appellant required maximal assistance in managing medication. The
Appellant required extensive assistance with bathing and dressing upper and lower body,
walking, personal hygiene, and toilet use. A “Declined” and “Deteriorated” were found in the
Appellant’s ADL status and overall self-sufficiency “as compared to 90 days, or since last
assessment if less than 90 days.
A review of the December 4, 2015, Uniform Assessment System New York (UANSY)
Assessment found that the Appellant required “Total dependence, Full performance by others
during entire period” in the Functional Status section of Meal Preparation, Ordinary housework,
Stairs and Shopping. The Appellant required maximal assistance in managing medication. The
Appellant required extensive assistance with bathing and dressing lower body, walking, personal
hygiene, and toilet use. Most significantly, from the last assessment of June 3, 2015 to the recent
assessment of December 4, 2015, “No Change was found in the Appellant’s ADL status and
overall self-sufficiency “as compared to 90 days, or since last assessment if less than 90 days.
The finding of “No Change” in Appellant's ADLs in the December 4, 2015 UAS, clearly
contradicts the Plan's assessment on December 16, 2015 of “a significant improvement in your
physical functioning, it had been proposed that your physical needs could be met by decreasing
your PCA hours to 70 hours/week (10 hours/day x 7 days/week).”
At the hearing, the Appellant's daughter and representative, rebutted the Plan's testimony
and documentation. The Appellant's daughter stated that a physical therapist did not meet with
her mother and that a proper assessment of her mother was never done. She added emphatically,
that her mother has never had the benefit of a nurse assessment in a manner that was detailed,
constructive or meaningful, and that rather, assessments if done at all, were conducted over the
telephone. The Appellant's daughter stated that rather than reduce the Appellant's hours, the Plan
was informed that the Appellant fell in 2015 and broke her arm and as a result needed more, not
reduced hours. To support her testimony, Appellant's daughter submitted into evidence a January
28, 2016 Medical Letter that confirms that the Appellant lives alone, suffers from multiple issues
including debility, dementia, and severe osteoarthritis. In addition, Appellant's daughter
14
FH# 7212695N
submitted a January 28, 2016 Letter that confirmed that the Appellant suffered a fracture of her
left wrist that has to treated with non-operative management consisting of several weeks of
immobilization and that as a result, has developed restricted use of her left upper extremity.
In conclusion, a comparative review of the June 3, 2015 and December 4, 2015 Uniform
Assessment System New York (UANSY) Assessment (Comprehensive) Reports of the
Appellant’s personal care needs rebuts the Plan’s reasons for its determination to reduce the
Appellant's personal care services from 84 hours per week to 70 hours per week on the grounds
that “not medically necessary”. The record of progressive decline of the Appellant and the
increased need for maximal assistance found the December 4, 2015 directly contradicts the
Plan’s conclusion that Appellant has made significant improvement in health and ADLs.
For the foregoing reasons, the December 28, 2015, determination by the Appellant’s
Managed Long Term Care plan, Centers Plan for Healthy Living to reduce the Appellant’s
Personal Care Services authorization from 84 hours per week to 70hours per week, is not correct
and cannot be sustained.
DECISION AND ORDER
The December 28, 2015, determination by the Appellant’s Managed Long Term Care
plan, Centers Plan for Healthy Living, to reduce the Appellant’s Personal Care Services
authorization from 84 hours per week to 70 hours per week is not correct and is reversed.
1. The Managed Long Term Care Plan, Centers Plan for Healthy Living, is directed to
immediately restore the Appellant’s Personal Care Services authorization back to the
amount of 84hours per week and to take no further action upon the December 28, 2015,

2. The Managed Long Term Care Plan, Centers Plan for Healthy Living, is directed to
continue to provide the Appellant with a Personal Care Services authorization in the
amount of 84 hours weekly.

in order to comply with the above directives, it is directed to notify the Appellant and the
Appellant's representative promptly in writing as to what documentation is needed. If such
information is required, the Appellant or the Appellant's representative must provide it to the
Managed Long Term Care plan promptly to facilitate such compliance.
15
FH# 7212695N
As required by 18 NYCRR 358-6.4, the Managed Long Term Care plan must comply
immediately with the directives set forth above.
