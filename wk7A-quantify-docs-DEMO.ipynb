    "# Investigations in which documents are key\n",
    "\n",
    "We might have in hand vast amounts of raw data from leaks, public records, web scrapes, FOIA requests, or whistleblowers. These could be emails, financial documents, contracts, social media posts, judicial judgments and discloser forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the buried story is another challenge. How do we read through thousands of pages to structure all this unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI will put on the brakes if you upload massive amounts of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll learn how to use modern investigative techniques to discover patterns, anomalies, and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a handful of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ProPublica**: <a href =\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\">Facebook (Still) Letting Housing Advertisers Exclude Users by Race</a>\n",
    "- This investigation uncovered how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race. Journalists used keyword searches to identify discriminatory practices in ad targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The New York Times**: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html\">The Disproportionate Risks of Driving While Black</a>\n",
    "- NYT reporters analyzed police traffic stop data to expose racial disparities. They used keyword searches to identify patterns in the data, revealing that Black drivers were more likely to be stopped and searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ICIJ**: <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/\">THE PANAMA PAPERS</a>\n",
    "- This monumental collaborative investigation dug through 11.5 million leaked files **(2.6 terabytes of data)** to expose the offshore holdings of world political leaders, links to global scandals, and details of the hidden financial dealings of fraudsters, drug traffickers, billionaires, celebrities, sports stars and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll learn to quantify unstructured text with this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confession Judgments\n",
    "\n",
    "Confession Judgments have been around since the Middle Ages, but are especially common in New York State.\n",
    "\n",
    "This legal procedure is a signed agreement where someone admits they owe money and allows the creditor to get a court judgment without a lawsuit if they don’t pay. It saves time for creditors but can be risky for debtors because they give up their right to defend themselves in court.\n",
    "\n",
    "You scrape thousands of confession judgments from NYS court website and want to quantify how many have been signed by residents to deal with falling behind in rent or mortgage payments, or on utility bills. You also discover an interesting confession judgment and decide you want to quantify that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps we need to take:\n",
    "1. Acquisition, either through scraping, FOAI, or being given files by a source(s)\n",
    "2. Organzing\n",
    "3. Reading & understanding a few to uncover any patterns\n",
    "4. Structuring unstructured content to quantify values\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work our way up to that challenge."
